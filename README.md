# The Pragmatic Programmer (exercises)

This is my attempt at solving some of the exercises from the book [**The Pragmatic Programmer (2020)**](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/) by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt. Note that not all of the exercises have been solved. The code is not guaranteed to work in all environments.
